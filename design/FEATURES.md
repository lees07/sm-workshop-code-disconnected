** remember [link these back to github][1] when applicable **

This is a list to keep a sort-of "slicksheet" for this app.

## Implemented features

## Planned features
* Core cut and paste capability

## Non-functional features
The list of things that are features but not directly mapped to user capability

## Scratch ideas 
* Highly distributed and fault tolerant (non-functional)
