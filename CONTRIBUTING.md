# CONTRIBUTING
I'd love to have your help! There aren't a whole lot of rules around this right now. But here are a few.

1. Please make sure to track your changes against an open issue (you can write one if nothing exists).
2. Don't solve multiple things in the same PR - it's likely it will get rejected if too many changes are all grouped together
3. If you are making a major changes - e.g. APIs or look and feel - please start an issue conversation for design consensus before you get too far implementing changes.


THANKS FOR PARTICIPATING!!!
